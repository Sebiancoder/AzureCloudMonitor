# Azure Cloud Monitor

This repository contains the code for the Azure Cloud Monitor (pictured below), a physical device powered by an ESP32, which can be used to display Azure cost data, alert for high usage, and control unexpected spending. This project was developed as a final project for my CS3651: Prototyping Intelligent Devices class at Georgia Tech.

A sister repository exists for this project [here](https://github.com/Sebiancoder/AzureCloudMonitorMotorControl), which contains code for the motor controller, a separate microcontroller (Arduino ATMega2650) that interfaces with the ESP32 via I2C protocol and is responsible for controlling the motors on the digit rotors.
